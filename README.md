# Endemic Birds of Bolivia

# I. Introduction

Bolivia has access to the most important ecological regions of tropical South America. It is one of the few countries in the world to have a major portion of global biodiversity concentrated within its national boundaries (Pierre L. Ibisch). Of  the  global  total  of  218  Endemic  Bird  Areas  (EBAs), 47 (22%) are situated in continental South America, and 24 of these  (51%)  are  partially  or  entirely  located  in  the  tropical  Andes  from  Bolivia  to  the Cordillera de Mérida of Venezuela.  A total of 355 restricted-range species (whose  breeding ranges  do  not  exceed  50,000  km2)  distributed  in  43  families  (45%  of  all  South  American families) occur in the tropical Andes (366 species when including the Cordillera de Mérida),  corresponding  to  62  %  (64%)  of  all  restricted-range  species  in  continental South  America. The  prevalence  of restricted-range species is a widespread phenomenon in montane areas of the northern Neotropics. In addition to high levels of endemism, montane avifaunas are also unique in terms of ecological  roles, as  evidenced by  the  richness of nectarivorous  birds and  bird-pollinated plants (Sebastian K. Herzog and Gustavo H. Kattan). The map shows the distribution of the endemic birds of Bolivia.

# II. Methodology

The data for this map was obtained from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The data will be processed using javascript, node, phython and/or other programming languages. The deliverable product will be a browser based interactive map.

## A. Data

The data was downloaded from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The data processing and visualization for this map include JavaScript libraries like D3js, Mapbox Gl GS, QGIS as well the use of Phython/Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas.

The data will be transformed into GeoJSON and/or Topojson files as the raw format currently are shapefiles. The structure of this project is an interactive map with information relevant to the endemic birds of Bolivia. The map will contain photographs and information about each specie.

## B. Medium for delivery

The map will be a web browser-based application accessible to desktop devices. In order to have the best interaction for the user, the map will not be accessible across mobile devices. The JavaScript (JS) frameworks likely to be used are HTML, SVG, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Assembly.css and others.

## C. Application layout

## D. Thematic representation

The data in this project will be visually represented by polygons. These polygon areas will be shown in the map using different hues to encode nominal distinctions by specie.

## E. User interaction

This map is based on user interface and visualization. It will have different UI elements like checkboxes, toggle and simple buttons, designed icons, tool tips, pop-up windows, bars, pan/zoom, hover and click on features to retrieve information.

## F. Aesthetics and design considerations

## G. Conclusion

it is possible to use these files in order to make an interactive map through the use of design and data visualization. Thus, the purpose of this map is to create awareness about the importance of habitats conservation for the impact they have in the species around the world.
